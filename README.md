# UniPlan

UniPlan is a planner platform intended for university students, inspired by my Google Sheets monster spreadsheet. I always hoped for a better, more visually appealing place for my the most essential tracker needs: TODO tracking, Internship Tracking, Finance tracking, and Resume tracking. UniPlan aspires to be a no-nonsense, clutter free platform optimized for the everday ambitious university student.

Features planned for the future:
- Option to add custom page in sidebar, with a number of page templates to choose from
- Added customizability (theme, accent color)
- Notification scheduler
- Mobile support
