# UniPlan 🌵

UniPlan is a planner platform intended for university students, inspired by my Google Sheets monster spreadsheet. I always hoped for a better, more visually appealing place for my the most essential tracker needs: TODO tracking, Internship Tracking, Finance tracking, Degree planning, and a motivation shrine. UniPlan aspires to be a no-nonsense, clutter free platform optimized for the everyday ambitious university student.
